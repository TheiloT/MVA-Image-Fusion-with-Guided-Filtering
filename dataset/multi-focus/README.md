The source images are divided into two datasets: a grayscale one and a color one. The grayscale dataset contains 10 pairs of classical multi-focus images such as the "clock", "pepsi", "lab", etc. The color dataset contains 20 pairs of color source images from the Lytro multi-focus image dataset created by Dr. Mansour Nejati et al. at https://mansournejati.ece.iut.ac.ir/content/lytro-multi-focus-dataset.
